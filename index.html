        <p><em>The Avatar <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-egQ79OrYCs">The Last AirBender.</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>The world is divided into four nations -- the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation and and the Air Nomads.</p>
        <p>Each represented by a natural element for which the nation is named. Benders have the ability to control and manipulate the element from their nation.</p>
        <p>Only the Avatar is the master of all four elements. </p>
        <p>The ruthless Fire Nation wants to conquer the world but the only bender who has enough power, the Avatar, has disappeared ... until now. </p>
